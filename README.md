This is my [IA-340](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=258336) repository for lab assignments and projects. 

## Course Description

*Data mining* is the nontrivial extraction of previously unknown and potentially useful information from (large) data sets to help explain current behaviors and anticipate future outcomes. Students will apply data mining and knowledge discovery methods to data sets from business, industry, and government. The course is team-oriented, project-based, and grounded in the relevant legal and ethical context.

## Purpose

This repository contains code, notebooks, and data related to **IA-340: Data Mining, Modeling, and Knowledge Discovery** coursework. The goal is to demonstrate data analytics using Python, SQL, AWS, and AI.
